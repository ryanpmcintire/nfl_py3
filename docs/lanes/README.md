# Lanes

A lane file is the state a fresh session needs to continue a task after the
previous session was cleared. One file per task, named by a short slug. The
session that works a lane updates it whenever a unit of work completes, and
every response ends with a one-line clear verdict (AGENTS.md, Lanes and
clearing). The status line shows the most recently touched lane.

A lane file has five short sections and stays under one page:

- **Goal**: one or two sentences, including what done looks like.
- **State**: what is shipped, committed or pushed; exact file paths.
- **Tried**: what was attempted and the measured result, so it is not redone.
- **Next**: the exact next step, with the command or file to open.
- **Open**: questions only the owner can answer, and decisions deferred.

Lanes that are finished move to `done/` with a final State section. A fresh
session reads this index, then the lane the prompt names, or the most recently
modified lane when the prompt just says to continue.
